Tips for getting Unity files to copy with their attributes in Github:
  - this seemed to work in creating the repo DopplerIsland with the folder contents I created last night; when this folder was uploaded to the original repo (GGJ14) last night, upon opening it today, the scene was grey and everything was unlinked again.  Fortunately, I had also made a manual backup to my flash drive so could try again.  I originally tried this afternoon to fix the GGJ14 outdoor branch version, but nothing I tried seemed to work at that time.

Here's what seems to have worked in my fresh repo:


- when copying over a folder that had been previously uploaded to Github (if transferring via Windows file tree), there are 3 things that need to be deleted from the folder being copied:   .gitattributes (if used), .gitignore, and (must be removed) the hidden folder ".git"  -- else conflicts will happen and Github gets confused


- I also used .gitignore with the lines shown below (recommended on a coding advice website, combined with part of Github's automatic Unity specific .gitignore).  A project using UDK would probably also want to use a section specific to that program (see https://gist.github.com/eralston/5351235 for example):
